				<p>With Bumi about to launch his attack. You draw the nearby earth to surround yourself in a defensive armour</p>
				<p>You will take his attack full on and then counter swiftly before he has a chance to launch a second attack<br>
					Bumi's attack stops just before it reaches you. Suddenly, the ground below your feet collapses and your legs sink into the ground. You fell for Bumi's ruse. Should have known he would not launch a straightforward attack.

					Better luck next time. The winner is Bumi.
