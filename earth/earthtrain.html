					You continue to hone your earth bending skills. Exceeding most of your other classmates. Your talent is matched only by one other student. His name is Bumi. The two of you have dueled 6 times, each resulting in a Draw. What he lacks for in raw power, he makes up for in his weird and impossible to read attacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone is eager for both of you to settle who is the strongest once and for all. The other classmates circle you and egg you both on to fight it out.
