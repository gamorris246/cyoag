					You boldly state that you have nothing to prove.<br>
					<b>Bumi:</b> You surprise me <span id = "username"></span>, and I thought I was the unpredictable one. Apparently I still have alot to learn. To be honest, I was looking forward to defeating you.<br>
					Your calm head reminds me alot of Aang, a dear friend of mines from my childhood. Its a good thing we stopped. If I proved that I was the best the next thing you know, people around here would want to make me King or something.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You become great friends and rivals and continue to train together.
