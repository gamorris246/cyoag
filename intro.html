			<br>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
			<br>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. 
			<br>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, 
			<br>but when the world needed him most, 
			<br>he vanished. 
			<br>
			<br>Fifty years have passed 
			<br>many have lost hope 
			<br>that the avatar will ever return.
			<br>The people of the world need more than a hero.
			<br>They need a LEGEND
			<br>They need you.
