				<br>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
				<br>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. 
				<br>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, 
				<br>but when the world needed him most, 
				<br>he vanished. 
				<br>
				<br>Fifty years have passed 
				<br>many have lost hope 
				<br>that the avatar will ever return.
				<br>The people of the world need more than hero.
				<br>They need a LEGEND
				<br>... They need you.
