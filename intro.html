				<br>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
				<br>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. 
				<br>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, 
				<br>but when the world needed him most, he vanished. 
				<br>
				<br>Fifty years have passed and the world has begun to lose hope that the avatar will ever return.
				<br>The people of the world now face a new world, a divided world.
				<br>Young benders from all over the world have all but forgotten of the avatar
				<br>....and must now make their own legend.
