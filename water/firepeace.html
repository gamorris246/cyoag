				You submit the report to your Commander. 
				<p>
					There were no signs of the villagers preparing an offensive. We should send a peace envoy to discuss negotiations. Forming a treaty with them would be a good idea.   
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Your commander thanks you for the intel. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The next day you are transferred back to the main land. While leaving the frigid seas you hope to yourself that the commander will take your advice and not conduct any raids. Afterall, Commander Yon Rah seems like a nice guy.

					<strong> THE END!</strong>
