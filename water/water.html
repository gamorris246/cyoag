					You are a water bender <span id = "username"></span>! <br>
					Benders like you have the ability to levitate and move water. You live in the Icy thundra of the Southern water tribe. Its a small but close knit community.

					When the war with the Fire Nation began, many of the strong warriors left to provide aide to the world and help defend against the tyranical rule of the Fire nation. You have little control over your abilities so you have been tasked with staying and protecting the tribe.
